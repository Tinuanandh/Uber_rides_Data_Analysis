# Uber_rides_Data_Analysis

This project showcases how data analysis can provide actionable insights for operational improvements and customer satisfaction.
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of Uber ride data using Python to identify key patterns and insights. The dataset consists of 1,156 records detailing ride characteristics, including start and end times, trip category, trip purpose, and mileage. The analysis combines techniques of data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning to address multiple objectives.

Highlights:
> Analyzed ride data to uncover peak usage trends and popular locations.
> Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
> Applied data preprocessing and feature engineering for robust analysis.

Tools Used:
> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

How to Run:
> Clone this repository.
> Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute it to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

Data Preprocessing and Transformation
Initial steps involved cleaning the data, addressing missing values, and standardizing formats. Missing values for the trip purpose were replaced with "Not Applicable," and duplicates were removed. Date and time columns were transformed to include features like trip duration, time of day, and whether the trip occurred during morning, afternoon, evening, or night. Outliers in distance and duration were identified and removed using Interquartile Range (IQR) and Z-score methods, reducing the dataset to 33% of its original size for robust analysis.

Descriptive Analysis
Key insights from descriptive statistics showed that:

Trip Categories: 93% of the trips were business-related, while 7% were personal.
Purpose Distribution: Common purposes included meetings (16%), meals/entertainment (14%), and errands/supplies (11%).
Average Trip Characteristics: Trips averaged 10.5 miles and lasted approximately 19 minutes.
Outlier Metrics: Maximum trip distances and durations highlighted unusual events, which were flagged as potential anomalies.
Diagnostic Analysis
Visualizations were used to explore patterns in trip duration and mileage. Bar plots showed the predominance of business trips, while histograms revealed that most trips were under 50 miles and lasted less than 25 minutes. Analysis also linked specific purposes, such as customer visits, to longer average trip distances.

Prescriptive Analysis
Using a machine learning model (Linear Regression), the study analyzed the influence of features like trip distance, hour of the day, and month on trip duration. Results revealed that mileage had the strongest positive correlation with duration, while time of day negatively influenced it. The model achieved a robust R2 score of 0.8732 and a low RMSE of 0.372, indicating strong predictive capability. Recommendations include optimizing pricing strategies during peak hours and designing promotions targeting long-distance business trips.

Conclusion and Future Scope
This project successfully uncovered critical patterns in Uber trip data, providing actionable insights for operational improvements and customer satisfaction. Future work may explore clustering techniques to segment trip categories further or incorporate external factors such as weather or traffic data for more nuanced predictions.
